import Counter from '../../../src/components/counter/Counter'

Hello World! My name is Kristofer Escobar. This is my attempt at making a blog. I want to use this blog as a means of practicing some web development. I want to practice, and refresh my memory, of some algorithms and data structures. I'd like to make a blog entry for different algorithms and data structures. I'm also using this blog as an excuse to use GatsbyJS and React.  I want explain the topic as if I am teaching it to someone else and also accompany it with live examples.


Below is an example of a react component:
<Counter />
